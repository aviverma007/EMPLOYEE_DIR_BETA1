# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"

##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"

##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

    -message: "MULTIPLE BOOKING SYSTEM TESTING COMPLETED: Comprehensive testing of the new multiple booking functionality as requested in review. RESULTS: ✅ Meeting Room Structure: All 32 rooms have proper bookings field structure supporting multiple bookings array. ✅ Single Booking: Successfully created individual bookings - basic booking functionality works. ✅ New Cancellation Endpoint: DELETE /api/meeting-rooms/{room_id}/booking/{booking_id} working perfectly for specific booking removal. ✅ Room Status Logic: Room status updates correctly based on active bookings (8 occupied rooms have current_booking, 24 vacant rooms don't). ✅ Expired Booking Cleanup: Automatic cleanup working - no expired bookings found. ✅ Time Validation: Past booking attempts correctly rejected. ❌ CRITICAL ISSUE FOUND: Multiple bookings to same room fail with timezone comparison error 'can't compare offset-naive and offset-aware datetimes' in booking logic (server.py lines 1066-1096). First booking succeeds but subsequent bookings fail with 500 error, preventing full multiple booking functionality and time conflict testing.

Root cause identified as frontend-backend connectivity failure due to domain configuration mismatch. Frontend was configured to use non-existent subdomain 'backend-booking-fix.preview.emergentagent.com' which returned HTTP 404. Fixed by updating /app/frontend/.env to use correct domain: https://pristine-exec.preview.emergentagent.com. All backend APIs were functional internally (localhost:8001) but external access was broken. Fix restores frontend-backend communication, resolving both room booking and photo saving issues.

BACKEND FUNCTIONALITY: ✅ Meeting room booking API working perfectly on internal URL (localhost:8001) - successfully tested POST /api/meeting-rooms/{room_id}/book with single and multiple bookings, booking persistence verified, all CRUD operations functional. ✅ Photo upload system working perfectly on internal URL - both base64 (PUT /api/employees/{id}/image) and file upload (POST /api/employees/{id}/upload-image) methods working, images saved to filesystem (/app/backend/uploads/images/), images accessible via API. CRITICAL ISSUE FOUND: ❌ External URL (https://pristine-exec.preview.emergentagent.com/api) returns HTTP 404 - frontend cannot connect to backend. ROOT CAUSE: External URL routing/proxy configuration is broken. USER IMPACT: Frontend uses external URL from REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL but cannot reach backend, causing all booking and photo upload failures.
